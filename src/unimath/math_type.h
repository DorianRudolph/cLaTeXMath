/**
 * Represents math-version for digit, Latin and Greek alphabets.

 * <p>
 * This for maps a given Unicode character to the mathematical alphanumeric in various
 * math versions.
 *
 * Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols is a Unicode block comprising styled forms of
 * Latin and Greek letters and decimal digits that enable mathematicians to denote
 * different notions with different letter styles.
 *
 * <p>
 * Unicode includes many such symbols (in the range U+1D400â€“U+1D7FF). But notice that
 * there are several code-point come up as <Reserved> at Unicode, this class will
 * replace these <Reserved> code-points with the code-point that has the same "glyph"
 * representation.
 *
 * For example, the math-italic version of the character 'h' has the code-point
 * "U+1D455" that is reserved in Unicode, and it will be replaced by "U+210E" that has
 * the meaning of "PLANCK CONSTANT".
 *
 * <p>
 * See
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Alphanumeric_Symbols">
 * Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols
